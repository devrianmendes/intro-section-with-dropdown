Intro section with dropdown challenge from frontendmentor by devrianmendes.

In this challenge I wanted to use as many features (some) as possible for this project. It includes several event listeners for click, resize, load and css effects to make the challenge as close to a professional website as possible.

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

Also used eslint airbnb style to padronize javascript.
